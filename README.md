# Workout_Analysis
The aim of this project is to analyze my personal workout data in various ways that will allow me to analyze my progress over long periods of time.

This python project retrieves various sets of data from an xlsx file using pandas and manipulates the data in a way that is convenient for what is being observed. It also plots it in several ways using matplotlib.
